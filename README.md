# Project
This is a college project assignment, the requirement is to create an API with PHP, and it must be linked to a Relational Database.

# Stack
XAMPP used as the stack.

# How To Run:
1. Copy all files (Except from _movies.sql_) to your XAMPP project directory (I expect that you'll name it _movie_api_).
2. Go to _localhost/phpMyAdmin_ page and create another database named _movie_api_, then click on import tab and import _movies.sql_ present in this directory.
3. Done, Happy Hacking!
